A directory to store versioned mindmaps used for requirements gathering etc. You may need to download Xmind to view/explore/edit them https://www.xmind.net/

Some of the directory current content highlighted below, we try to update regularly when exploration expands.

___PROJECT: MODELING DATA FROM PERSONAL HEALTH DEVICES AND APPS___
 * [Platforms](https://github.com/regionostergotland/openehr_definitions/blob/master/mindmaps/platforms.xmind) exploration of data (mostly physical activity) gathered by different presonal health platforms (Google Fitness, Apple Health, Samsung Health, Withings, Garmin, Polar, Strava, MyFitnessPal etc.)
  * [Sleep](https://github.com/regionostergotland/openehr_definitions/blob/master/mindmaps/sleep.xmind) DAta about sleep in various platforms
 * [Activities](https://github.com/regionostergotland/openehr_definitions/blob/master/mindmaps/activities.xmind) Aggregation/mashup of activity datapoints from different health platforms. Useful as background for modeling.
 * [/PhysicalActivityInvestigation](https://github.com/regionostergotland/openehr_definitions/blob/master/mindmaps/PhysicalActivityInvestigation.xmind) some previous example gathering and modeling thoughts, now in part superseeded by recent archetype modeling

Background student project report (in Swedish) http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Aliu%3Adiva-157977 with first prototype source code available at ... It pulls data from Google Fitness (that is available on android and iOS) and imports it to an openEHR platform. Currently the source code is updated as a summer project at Region Östergötland using our software dev departments internal legacy versioning tools (TFS)... The updated version will be released as Open Source too, likely on GitHub again.

Current modeling (July 2019+) discussions are mostly happening in https://openehrclinical.slack.com/ in the channel #physical-activity, and the openEHR archetypes are being versioned in https://github.com/regionostergotland/CKM-mirror/tree/master/local/physical_activity (and sometimes in other directories in the same repository where the tools happen to place them). 

When a first draft is finished there will be a proper international review round of the archetypes and broader discussions in the community and toolset at https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/
